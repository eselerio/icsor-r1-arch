# ASM2D-TSN Simulation

## 1. Title and simulation summary

The current ASM2D-TSN implementation in this repository provides a mechanistic steady-state simulation workflow plus the canonical workbook contract for a two-step nitrification ASM2d formulation. The simulation module exposes the same high-level bundle shape used by the simulation portion of `main.ipynb`: dataset, metadata, Petersen matrix, composition matrix, matrix bundle, and artifact paths.

The notebook-facing dataset now persists both ASM component fractions and composite variables for both influent and effluent sides. The training and testing contract remains metadata-driven: only operational variables plus influent component fractions are independent variables, and only measured effluent composites are dependent variables.

## 2. Background and system or process context

ASM2d extends the activated-sludge model family to include biological phosphorus removal together with nitrogen and carbon conversions. The present repository variant is being prepared as an ASM2D-TSN formulation with explicit two-step nitrification, meaning nitrite and nitrate are represented separately instead of being collapsed into a single oxidized-nitrogen state.

For this repository, the workbook fixes the process ordering, state ordering, composite-output ordering, and parameter naming. The `composition_matrix` sheet is the runtime source of truth for measured-output columns and composition coefficients. On top of that contract, the repository implements a mechanistic steady-state simulation routine that uses the configured ASM2D-TSN process rates and workbook-derived composition matrices to generate reproducible composite-output datasets for notebook use.

## 3. Mathematical definition and governing relations

The model contains a stoichiometric matrix whose rows are processes and whose columns are state variables. The state set contains dissolved states

$$
[S_O, S_F, S_A, S_{NH4}, S_{NO2}, S_{NO3}, S_{N2}, S_{PO4}, S_I, S_{ALK}]
$$

and particulate states

$$
[X_I, X_S, X_H, X_{PAO}, X_{PP}, X_{PHA}, X_{AOB}, X_{NOB}, X_{MeP}, X_{MeOH}].
$$

The current contract intentionally does not include an internal `X_TSS` state variable. Instead, `TSS` remains a measured composite output computed directly from particulate-state composition coefficients.

Several stoichiometric coefficients are not entered directly. They are derived from continuity equations:

$$
\nu_{j,NH4} = -\sum_{i \neq NH4} \nu_{j,i} i_{N,i}
$$

$$
\nu_{j,PO4} = -\sum_{i \neq PO4} \nu_{j,i} i_{P,i}
$$

$$
\nu_{j,ALK} = \frac{\nu_{j,NH4}}{14} - \frac{\nu_{j,NO2}}{14} - \frac{\nu_{j,NO3}}{14} + \frac{\nu_{j,PO4}}{31}
$$

$$
TSS = \sum_{i \in \text{particulates}} c_{TSS,i} x_i
$$

The composition matrix maps internal state variables to the measured composite variables `[COD, TN, TKN, TP, TSS]`.

The current runtime implementation treats the reactor as a completely mixed steady-state system and solves the nonlinear residual balances directly. For hydraulic retention time $\tau$ with dilution rate $D = 24 / \tau$, the steady-state residual is

$$
r(x) = D(x_{in} - x) + \nu^T \rho(x, u) + a(x, u)
$$

where $\nu$ is the Petersen matrix, $\rho(x, u)$ is the ASM2D-TSN process-rate vector, and $a(x, u)$ is the external oxygen-transfer contribution driven by the configured aeration setting.

For each sampled operating point, the repository solves $r(x) = 0$ with a bounded nonlinear least-squares solve. The runtime uses an ASM1-style protocol:

1. construct a physically biased initial guess from the influent state, HRT, aeration setting, and optional warm start from the previous successful solve
2. solve the bounded residual system with `scipy.optimize.least_squares`
3. repeat from a biomass-rich multistart guess and keep the solution with the smaller maximum residual
4. if the residual is still above the configured acceptance threshold, run a `solve_ivp` dynamic-relaxation trajectory and use its terminal state as a final least-squares initial guess
5. reject the operating point if the final solution is unsuccessful or remains above the configured acceptance threshold

## 4. Inputs, outputs, state variables, and assumptions

Inputs to the simulation are configuration-driven:

- hydraulic retention time and aeration sampled from configured operational ranges using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)
- influent state variables sampled from configured state ranges using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)
- the ordered process list
- the ordered state-variable list
- the ordered composite-variable list
- the full parameter table with values and units

Outputs of the simulation workflow are:

- a dataset containing operational variables, influent component fractions, influent composites, effluent component fractions, and effluent measured composites
- metadata describing the simulation schema and matrix shapes
- the numeric Petersen and composition matrices used by the notebook
- optional persisted CSV and JSON artifacts under `data/asm2d-tsn/simulation`

Current assumptions:

- the workbook `composition_matrix` sheet is the runtime source of truth for composite schema and coefficients
- `config/params.json` remains the authoritative source for solver settings, kinetic parameters, and non-composite simulation configuration
- workbook-derived composition artifacts may be cached with workbook fingerprint metadata for deterministic reuse
- the current runtime is a mechanistic steady-state nonlinear solve intended to support notebook reproducibility and higher-fidelity dataset generation

## 5. Implementation used in this repository

The implementation is in [src/models/simulation/asm2d_tsn_simulation.py](src/models/simulation/asm2d_tsn_simulation.py).

The repository currently implements:

1. loading the ASM2D-TSN workbook definition from `config/params.json`
2. resolving the canonical workbook path from `config/paths.json`
3. generating the parameter table sheet
4. generating the stoichiometric matrix sheet with direct and continuity-derived formulas
5. generating the composition matrix sheet with parameter-linked formulas
6. building numeric Petersen and composition matrices where composition schema and coefficients come from workbook `composition_matrix`
7. sampling operational conditions and influent states from configured ranges using seeded Latin Hypercube Sampling for well-stratified coverage
8. solving mechanistic steady-state effluent states and persisting both component-fraction and composite views
9. writing the canonical `.xlsx` file under `data/asm2d-tsn`
10. persisting simulation artifacts under `data/asm2d-tsn/simulation`

## 6. Architecture, orchestration, or adopted approach details and standard name, when relevant

The adopted approach is a configuration-driven simulation and workbook contract. The runtime module reads only repository configuration and writes only configured artifacts. This keeps path resolution compliant with repository rules and avoids hardcoded filesystem locations.

Runtime architecture:

1. `parameter_table` is written first as the source table for model constants
2. the numeric Petersen and composition matrices are built from the same configured coefficient definitions
3. operational conditions and influent states are jointly sampled from configured ranges using seeded Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) via `scipy.stats.qmc`; for dataset generation a pooled LHS design of `chunk_size × max_sample_attempts` points is pre-generated per chunk so that each retry consumes the next LHS point rather than an independent draw
4. a bounded nonlinear steady-state solve updates the internal state, with multistart and dynamic-relaxation fallback when the first pass is not acceptable
5. the composition matrix maps the internal state to the composite output space
6. only converged operating points are admitted into the generated dataset
7. the dataset and metadata are returned in the notebook-facing contract and may also be persisted to disk

This design ensures that when workbook `composition_matrix` columns or coefficients change, runtime measured-output schema and matrix values follow that workbook change directly.

## 7. Dataset-generation or execution workflow

The present workflow is:

1. call `run_asm2d_tsn_simulation`
2. generate a dataset with both fraction and composite columns for influent and effluent states
3. optionally persist the dataset and metadata under `data/asm2d-tsn/simulation`
4. inspect the returned Petersen and composition matrices in the notebook
5. use the same matrices for null-space and constraint analysis

The companion helper `create_asm2d_tsn_workbook` continues to generate the canonical workbook under `data/asm2d-tsn`.

## 8. Limitations and expected failure modes

Current limitations:

- the persisted schema is intentionally wider than the supervised learning contract, so consumers must follow metadata `independent_columns`, `dependent_columns`, and `ignored_columns`
- the implementation is aimed at simulation-notebook reproducibility and matrix analysis, not yet at plant-calibrated prediction

Expected failure modes:

- formula breakage if parameter names or row ordering are changed without regenerating the workbook
- malformed `composition_matrix` sheet headers or non-numeric coefficient cells that violate the workbook parsing contract
- downstream inconsistency if future ASM2D-TSN code hardcodes state or process order instead of loading configuration
- solver convergence failure if sampled influent states or operating conditions are incompatible with a physically acceptable steady state under the configured kinetics
